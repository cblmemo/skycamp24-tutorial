    "\n",
    "SkyPilot has made finetuning LLMs on any clouds super easy. Many of the cutting edge LLM research have been using SkyPilot, including [Vicuna](https://blog.skypilot.co/finetuning-llama2-operational-guide/), [vLLM](https://blog.skypilot.co/serving-llm-24x-faster-on-the-cloud-with-vllm-and-skypilot/), and [Mistral.ai](https://docs.mistral.ai/cloud-deployment/skypilot/).\n",

    "# Specifying resource requirements of tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Special resource requirements are specified through the `resources` field in the SkyPilot task YAML. For example, to request 2 A100 GPU for your task, simply add it to the YAML like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "resources:\n",
    "  accelerators: A100:2\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "run: .....\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **💡 Hint -** In addition to `accelerators`, you can specify many more requirements, such as `disk_size`, a specific `cloud`, `region` or `zone`, `instance_type` and more! You can find more details in the [YAML configuration docs](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/yaml-spec.html)."

    "# Accessing data from object stores \n",
    "\n",
    "SkyPilot allows easy movement of data between task VMs and cloud object stores. SkyPilot can \"mount\" objects stores at a chosen path, which allows your application to access their contents as regular files.\n",
    "\n",
    "These mount paths can be specified using the `file_mounts` field. For example, you may have noticed this in `finetune.yaml`:\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "file_mounts:\n",

    "    store: gcs\n",
    "```\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement directs SkyPilot to mount the contents of `gs://$BUCKET_NAME/` at `/artifacts/`. When the task accesses contents of `/artifacts/`, they are streamed from and to the `$BUCKET_NAME` GCS bucket. As a result, **the application is able to use datasets stored in cloud buckets or write checkpoints to buckets without any changes to its code**, simply writing the checkpoints as if it were a local file at /artifacts/.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **💡 Hint** - In addition to object stores, SkyPilot can also copy files from your local machine to the remote VM! Refer to [SkyPilot docs](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/syncing-code-artifacts.html) for more information."
